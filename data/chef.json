        "description": "French-born Dominique Crenn is the first female chef in the USA to hold three Michelin stars, which she was awarded for her San Francisco restaurant Atelier Crenn in 2019. Known for her French inspired food and seasonal menus, Crenn is also the proprietor of the one Michelin starred Bar Crenn, an elegant Parisian-style wine bar serving small plates, and Petit Crenn, a French-style bistro. Crenn is committed to sustainable cuisine, removing land-based meat from all her restaurants in 2019, and sourcing the majority of her ingredients from her own farm. When the Michelin Guide introduced the green star in 2020, both Atelier Crenn and Bar Crenn were among the first establishments to be recognized.",

        "description": "Alice Waters is chef patron of Berkeley’s legendary Chez Panisse, the birthplace of California cuisine. Opened in 1971, at a time when US cuisine was characterised by convenience and exaggerated technique, the simple, sustainable fare at Chez Panisse radically broke the mould. From the outset, Waters demanded local, seasonal ingredients that were organically and sustainably grown, and the influence of these principles can be seen in the work of America’s leading chefs today. Waters is also a national public policy advocate for school lunch reform and universal access to healthy, organic foods. She created the Edible Schoolyard program in 1995 and the Chez Panisse Foundation in 1996.",

She wrote and co-wrote four books on the subject, and is particularly well-known for her 1976 book The Taste of Country Cooking, which contains both recipes and reminiscences about her childhood growing up in a small Virginia Piedmont farming community of freed slaves. With an emphasis on living with the seasons, the book was ahead of its time in many ways, and enjoyed a surge in popularity in 2017 after it was featured in an episode of Top Chef.",
